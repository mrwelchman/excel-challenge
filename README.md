For this demonstration of my Excel acumen, I was provided with a spreadsheet with 4,114 Kickstarter campaigns as well as information about them like whether they were successful or not, country of origin, etc. Using nothing but my knowledge and experience using Excel to manipulate and analyze data, I was able to sort through it and make a few observations, which are noted in the spreadsheet and document in this repository.


#### Tools Utilized:
* Excel
* Word
