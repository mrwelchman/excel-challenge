### Nothing screams "I'm a professional!" like being able to handle Excel.

Kickstarter is a popular fundraising platform that allows regular people like you or me to crowdsource projects ranging from collections of poetry to board games to theater productions and on and on down the river that is the seemingly neverending flow of new ideas.

For this demonstration of my Excel acumen, I was provided with a spreadsheet containing 4,114 Kickstarter campaigns as well as information about them such as whether they were successful or not, country of origin, currency the fundraiser was conducted in, etc. Using nothing but my knowledge and experience using Excel to manipulate and analyze data, I was able to sort through it and make a few observations, which are noted in the spreadsheet and document in this repository.


#### Tools Utilized:
* Excel
* Word


Using the data that I organized, sorted, manipulated, calculated, and other "ateds" from the analytics sheet, I was able to create a table and visualize it. This shows the status of all campaigns by category. You can also toggle through countries to see the specific data for that country, however here I have visualized the entire dataset. The table is in this repository, so feel free to open it up and explore.

Here is another table and visualization, this time looking at subcategories of campaigns.

Finally, here is a visualization and table that shows the rate of success or failure of Kickstarter campaigns by month.

These are just a few examples of some Excel based visualizations. While this dataset is from Kickstarter, the same sort of analyzation and modifications and visualizations can be applied to other companies, industries, charities, pretty much anything that keeps records.

In the Word file in this repository, you can read a few of the conclusions I was able to draw from the dataset as well as a few ideas for further information we can squeeze out of the data.

Thanks for checking this out. Reach out with any questions.
